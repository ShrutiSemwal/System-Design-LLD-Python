"""
Summary of Core Entities:

-->Board: Represents the 3x3 game grid. Manages a 2D matrix of cells and provides methods to update cell values, validate positions, and check for win or draw conditions.
-->Cell: Represents an individual square on the board. Each cell can either be empty or contain a symbol (X or O).
-->Player: Represent a player with a symbol and optionally a name or ID.
-->Symbol: Represents the value a cell can holdâ€”X, O, or EMPTY.
-->Game: Controls the overall game flow. Alternates turns, validates moves, updates the board, and checks for winning or draw conditions.
-->GameStatus: Represents the current state of the game. Possible values include IN_PROGRESS, DRAW, WINNER_X, and WINNER_O.
-->Scoreboard: Tracks cumulative scores and outcomes across multiple game sessions.
-->TicTacToeSystem: Orchestrates the creation of games and ties together core components like the scoreboard and game engine.

Implementation / Inheritance ("is-a"):
-->Game --|> GameSubject: Game is a subject that can be observed.
-->Scoreboard --|> GameObserver: Scoreboard is an observer that listens to Game events.
-->RowWinningStrategy, ColumnWinningStrategy, DiagonalWinningStrategy --|> WinningStrategy: These are concrete implementations of the winning strategy contract.
-->InProgressState, WinnerState, DrawState --|> GameState: These are concrete implementations of the game state contract.

Key Design Patterns:
-->Strategy Pattern
-->State Pattern
-->Observer Pattern- The Game (Subject) and Scoreboard (Observer)
-->Facade Pattern- TicTacToeSystem acts as a facade
-->Singleton Pattern- TicTacToeSystem class is implemented as a singleton to ensure a single, globally accessible entry point to the system
